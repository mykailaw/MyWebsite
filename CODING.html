    <h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>
    <p>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes
        that I have read over the years.</p>

    <p> Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad,
        grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

    <h3> Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li> 1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)
        <li>175g of tahini
        <li>6 sundried tomatoes
        <li> Half a red pepper
        <li> A pinch of cayenne pepper
        <li> 1 clove of garlic
        <li> A dash of olive oil
    </ul>

    <h3> Instructions </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely
        <li> Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely
        <li> Add all the ingredients into a food processor
        <li> Process all the ingredients into a paste
        <li> If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time
        <li> If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time
    </ol>
    <p>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and
        chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</p>

    <h3> Storage</h3>

    <p> Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after
        you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.

    <p> Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
